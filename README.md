  ## Description
  This is my first and complete full stack application! It is a simple blog site where users can create a username along with password which will be encrypted within the server. The site also allows you to create, edit and delete posts as well as commenting on other's posts. This app uses industry standard MVC and ORM techniques as well as password hashing, authentication and HTML templating.
